Create an HTML page that has inputs for a first name, last name, email address, and a checkbox, as well as a submit button.
Write the javascript that does the following (the app should be written as an object, like the example above):
When a user clicks the button, it checks to see that value is not empty (including the checkbox)
Hint: value !== '' and checked === true
If the input is empty, it adds a red border to the missing input
The script should check to see if the email address entered is valid
Hint:
  function validateEmail(email) {
    const re = /^(([^<>()[\]\\.,;:\s@\"]+(\.[^<>()[\]\\.,;:\s@\"]+)*)|(\".+\"))@((\[[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\])|(([a-zA-Z\-0-9]+\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}))$/;
    return re.test(email);
  }
If all values are entered correctly, the submit button should dissappear and a spinner should take its place
Hint: CSS Loader
After 3 seconds have passed, the spinner should be replaced with text that says "Thanks for signing up!"
Hint: Set timeout
When you're finished, upload a link to your Github Repo
