# Project Name:

30 Minute Film Festival Website (30MFF)

# Project Description:

**What is the project, what is the overall concept and theme, and what kind of experience you were striving to create?**

The main purpose of the project was to create a website for the 30 minute film festival we had during our communications lab lecture. A website was created with the intention to promote the video. The overall concept of the website was personally curated to the video content. The video was a "self-help" video intended to help students going through zoom fatigue. To address this problem in more depth, the home page was dedicated towards providing the visitors with more context on the problem - what zoom fatigue is and how it is a problem. The home page ends with a button which the viewers can click on and be lead to the video page. Hence I presented the problem - zoom fatigue - with the guidance of animated png images (created through procreate) to make the website more appealing and lively and provided a solution to the problem which is the video. 

I intended to make the theme of the website 'hand-drawn' /  to give a personal touch to it - to make it appear as not digital as possible. This relates to the topic of zoom fatigue - which is caused by an overdose of technology. To achieve this, I hand-drew the illustrations using procreate and added them to provide more visual information. I also created png animations to make the page more lively. 

The experience I was striving to create was as if browsing through an interactive, hand-drawn magazine. The main interactions are the buttons and the changing images as the user hovers over them on the about page. In order to persuade the viewers that zoom-fatigue was a problem, I felt the need to provide the motive / story behind the video through providing a visual experience to provoke an emotion from the users. Illustrations - I believe - are an efficient way to achieve that. 

# Process:

**How did you go about implementing the concept?**

Firstly, I wireframed my website using ADOBE XD but I ended up creating an entirely different design. I have uploaded the second (hand-drawn) wireframe onto my github (wireframe2.png). I found that wireframing by hand was less restrictive personally. The hand-drawn feel of the website was very much inspired by this wireframe session. As the wireframe was very detailed, implementing the concept was relatively easy. 

In addition to the animated illustrations, I wanted to add some interactivity to the website. I achieved this through javascript (addition of button and responsive color change / directed to another page when clicked) and css (images change when user hovers over it) - all of which enhanced the personal feel of the website. 

# Reflection / Evaluation:

**This should bookend the inital concept and talk about whether your expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version.**

I am personally satisfied with how the website turned out, taking to account to limited time we spent on html/css/javascript. I particularlly think the second wireframe session was what gave the website a personal feel. It also pushed me to experiment more, to create a blend between a digital website and hand-drawn illustraions. I also managed to get all the essential things working - the video, menu bar, javascript, animations, etc. The final website turned out to be very much similar to the second wireframe. It taught me how a detailed wireframe can really reduce the workload during the final implementation. 

If I have more skills and experience, I would have liked to have made the animations move according to the scrolling of the user.
