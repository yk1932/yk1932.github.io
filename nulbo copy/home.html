                The main purpose of the project was to create a website for the 30 minute film festival we had during our communications lab lecture. A website was created with the intention to promote the video. The overall concept of the website was personally curated to the video content. The video was a "self-help" video intended to help students going through zoom fatigue. To address this problem in more depth, the home page was dedicated towards providing the visitors with more context on the problem - what zoom fatigue is and how it is a problem.</p>
