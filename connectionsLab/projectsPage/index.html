            <div class="projectDescriptionSerif">1.1 – Inspiration and Direction</div>
            <div class="projectDescription">The environment which I tried to create for this assignment was centered around the theme of disproportionate objects. Primarily inspired by the works of the Russian surrealist, Vitaly Urzhumov, I wanted to create a landscape composed of objects that were either bigger or smaller than their average size. Through the abnormal sizes of the objects, I wanted to initially provoke a sense of confusion for the user. However, as seen in Urzhumov’s works, although the sizes are not normal, he makes sure to maintain balance in all other aspects of the work such as the side-objects (the tree in the first work, the man and cloud in the second, the mountains in the third), the lighting, the landscape, etc. He does this to set the emphasis on the few objects that are out of proportion. If he were to make everything disproportionate, there would be no focal point and the world will not be visually appealing to the eye of the viewer. I was inspired by these particular aspects of Urzhumov’s work.</div>

            <div class="projectDescription">
                    Environment: Surreal Landscape consisting of Disproportionate Everyday Objects<br><br>
                    Identity: The identity of the user is a person who stumbles across this landscape. To achieve this, I made sure to avoid making the user the obvious center of the terrain. The user was placed under a shaded area, behind a few trees. The main scene of the space is the portal and skeletons, illuminated with green light. This ensures that the user does not feel like the world was created for them – rather, they have coincidentally stumbled across an already existing scene. </div>

            <div class="projectDescription">
                    Working on this project made me realize the lack of limitations in using VR as a medium of implementing my vision. As it gives the developer to customize a 360 view of a scene, it is very similar to the way in which we view the real world. The act of looking around alone is a significant part of what makes VR an immersive and powerful tool for creating a place. Due to the 3 dimensional nature of the space, compared to 2D space, it seemed to have many more possibilities. Especially since my project dealt with size, more specifically the alteration of it, the extra z-axis contributed significantly in providing a larger surface to place and move around objects. The specific incorporation of sound into objects was another key component to increasing presence to the scene. Even in a very quiet room, there is always sound at low frequency. It is rare to come across a completely noiseless scene. For my scene, I incorporated the sound of an empty room, and a portal sound to add to the atmosphere. Even with the lack of movement and interaction, except looking around the 360 degree view, it seemed, there were enough properties – lighting, proportion, colors, depth, etc – to create a presence. Through this project, I learnt that it is not necessarily the complexity that matters as much as perfecting these fundamental properties in constructing a place – something to keep in mind moving forward with future projects. I also realized through the process of having more than one build, the importance of having enough time and flexibility to alter ideas in between builds as these changes in development process are equally important and significant. Many of the changes and additions I made in between builds have become an integral part of the scene – the portal, skeleton, color change, etc. This taught me alot about the nature of the development process and to always give myself more time than planned to work on the project to allow these changes.

    <!-- Project 2 -->

    <div id="project2" class="projectTitle">Two | Magic Calculator</div>

    <div class = "project">
        <div class = "section">
            <div class="projectDescription">The main activity used as the basis of the project was using a calculator. The goal was to re-imagine the calculator interface in a VR setting. The calculator most people are familiar with is either in the form of the physical calculator or as apps on our phones or computers. Both versions display the results on a two dimensional screen. Also, the interaction to input numbers is often restricted to the act of pressing buttons – whether they are physical  buttons or those on a screen. With this mind, we wanted to make use of the VR platform to design a functioning interactive calculator in a 3 dimensional space.<br><br>As the project’s emphasis is on the mix of both the usual (everyday) setting and a sense of the alternate, we decided to have two settings for the project. The first, user’s spawn location, is an everyday setting, located in a person’s bedroom. The bedroom is furnished with objects which an average person would possess – bed, drawer, bookshelf, etc. Non-textual elements – such as lighting and color – is used to naturally direct the user towards the calculator. The interactions in this room follow the conventions of the real world, gravity for example, to provide a clear distinction between this world and the alternate. The alternate world is accessed through clicking the calculator. The interactions that take place in this virtual calculator interface would have qualities which do not follow the everyday scene – flying, endless black background, cubes that float in space and snap to each other – creating a clear sense of an alternate reality.

        </div>

        <div class = "section">
            <div class="projectDescription">
                    The project managed to create an alternate version of both the interaction with the calculator and its internal interface. The alternate version of the interaction itself was achieved through prompting a different response when clicking the calculator as opposed to clicking the other objects in the room. When clicking the other objects, the user can grab and throw them whereas clicking the calculator teleports the user. This contrast clearly distinguishes the calculator from the rest of the objects. The alternate version of the interface is achieved through the visual and physical elements that clearly differ from the everyday scene. The relative flexibility in the alternate scene allows interactions – such as flying, floating cubes – to occur. 
                    <br><br>
                    The primary visual cue which prompts the user to interact with the calculator is the desk light. The calculator is placed in the center of a large desktop under a bright spotlight. When the user hovers the mouse over the calculator, the object luminates to indicate a special interaction and encourages the user to click.
                    <br><br>
                    In the alternate world, colors are used to represent the different status of the cubes and expression. Moving around and placing objects follow the conventions of many computer games (wasd) and mouse-click, allowing the user to quickly adapt to the controls. The “=” cube which exists in default, along with the block on the right corner, signals the user to place and block and add on to the expression.

    <!-- Project 3 -->

    <div id="project3" class="projectTitle">Three | Reflections</div>

    <div class = "project">
        <div class = "section">
            <div class="projectDescription">The environment of the space is a confined elliptical structured town composed of houses surrounding a central body of water, directly inspired by Keizersgracht in Amsterdam. The environment choice was taken with careful consideration, leading to a long ideation / brainstorming process. The setting of Amsterdam was chosen due to its capability to encompass our, more abstract, theme of reflection while providing more substance that helped us push the story forward.
                    <br><br>
                    The confined structure of the town acted as narrative guidance, leading us to question – why the town was confined in the first place? What existed beyond the town? Are the villagers aware of such an outside? – all of which inspired us to create a corrupted town in which the core tension underlying it stems from lack of awareness of the external world.
                    <br><br>
                    As such, the story is constructed around the central aim of bringing light to a phenomenon which occurs in the real world – deception. To communicate such an abstract concept in a tangible form, we had to design a space – composed of characters, speech, animation, environment, sound which all follow a central story. Also, the fictional aspects – the reflection, characters – all played a significant role in constructing a space capable of expressing such concept.

        <div class = "section">
            <div class="projectDescription">
                    This project taught me a lot on how to develop a theme, through story, in a VR setting. More specifically, it made me recognize the limitless number of approaches the creator can take when attempting to convey a story in VR. Space being the main medium of VR, we had to reconstruct the way in which we told the story. It was not limited to purely text (ex. books), sound (ex. songs, podcasts), visuals (ex. movie), etc. It was an integration of all these components, which made it flexible but also very challenging. As such, I found that we drew a lot of inspiration from many forms of media and combined them. For example, the scenes and spotlight in the reflected scene was inspired from theater. The interaction with NPCS was inspired by the approach taken by many open world games.
                    <br><br>
                    The final game, I think, achieved most of the goals intended for this project. The reason for feeling so has to do largely through constantly changing and adapting in the creation process. We made a lot of changes along the way to adapt to the VR interface, but made sure these changes did not take away the core message of the story.</div>
