Task 

1. MAKE a simple wireframe of one of your present/past projects.
2. MAKE a webpage version of the wireframe you have designed. Your assignment should include a .html file and a .css file. You could do this in a number of ways. For example, if your slide has a colored background, you could either implement the same background through CSS or you could upload an image and set that as the background for your web page.
3. DOCUMENT your progress and learnings from the making of the webpage
